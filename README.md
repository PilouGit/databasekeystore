# databasekeystore
This package provides functionality to use [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/KeyStore.html)  with support of multiple storage engine by implementing DatabaseKeyStoreRepository.
# Registring security provider.

To add the provider at runtime use:

```java
import java.security.Security;
import com.github.pilougit.security.databasekeystore.DatabaseKeyStoreProvider;
    
Security.addProvider(new DatabaseKeyStoreProvider());

```
The provider can also be configured as part of your environment via static registration by adding an entry to the java.security properties file (found in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security, where $JAVA_HOME is the location of your JDK/JRE distribution). You'll find detailed instructions in the file but basically it comes down to adding a line:
```java
security.provider.<n>=com.github.pilougit.security.databasekeystore.DatabaseKeyStoreProvider


```


# Supported Storage Engine

* JPA Storage Engine
* Memory Storage Engine


# JPA Storage Engine
The JPA Storage Engine pass by initialize a DatabaseKeyStoreJpaRepository with a entity manager:
```java
EntityManager em=...
KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance("DatabaseKeyStoreProvider", "DatabaseKeyStoreProvider");
keystore.load(new DatabaseKeyStoreLoadStoreParameter(new DatabaseKeyStoreJpaRepository(em), new AESGcmCipheringKeyService()));


```
# DataBase schema for HSQLDB

Schema pre prepared for hsqldb database can be created by executing:

``` sql
create schema databasekeystore;

create table databasekeystore.keyentry(id bigint not null  GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,alias varchar(255) not null, entry LONGVARCHAR not null,  primary key (id));

```

# Encryption schema

Private keys will be stored according to the implementation of CipheringKeyService which is either currently:
* noop ciphering engine NoOpCipheringKeyService
* AES/GCM engine AESGcmCipheringKeyService
